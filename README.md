# home-assistant-voice-assistant
This project transforms a vintage **Siemens W48 rotary phone** into a modern, voice-controlled assistant using **ESPHome**, **ESP32**, and **Home Assistant Assist** (powered by OpenAI). Lift the handset, speak naturally, and hear responses through the original receiver.
